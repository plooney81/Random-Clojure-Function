# random-clojure-function

Project that returns a random built in clojure function. 

The amount of functions that are included with clojure.core namespace are so vast that it may seem like it would take forever in order to learn them all.
This is the reasoning behind this project. It will be a fun way to familiarize myself with more of the core functions while building the app with them!
